## Game Overview
Rhythm-type game where you must pick out words from a conversation between two criminals to build cases against them. Created in a combined total of only 3 hours for 'Trijam' #272 for the theme 'Bidirectional', with some small updates after the jam voting has finished.

## Installation and Use
Only the Unity script files are included in this repository therefore it is not possible to install and run the entire Unity project. However a playable version is available on my [itch.io](https://fraser-curry-games.itch.io/eavesdropper) page.
